    <p>
        Someone once told me that during my academic job search, I
        should make all my teaching eval data available online.
    </p>
    <p>
        This page displays the quantitative and qualitative
        evaluations on all my teaching to date (except those for which
        the module leader forgot to perform evaluation). Each module
        was evaluated with a questionnaire part-way through term,
        consisting mostly of statements scored for agreement from 1
        (worst) to 5 (best), with a couple of qualitative comments at
        the end. For each module, there's a bar chart of the mean
        score on each quantitative measure, and then a subheading for
        each qualitative question with <em>all</em> of the comments
        quoted underneath (in their original form, without spell
        checking or other editorialising). <i>n</i> is the number of
        students who filled out the survey. There is also a bar chart
        of <a href="#averages">my average scores across all
        modules</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before all that, here are two comments left anonymously by
        students outside of the official evaluation process. The second
        student nominated me for an award:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="display">
        {# From the email Jess sent me. Pretty sure this was Ollie. #}
        The most positive aspect was my experience in seminars. Some
        recognition needs to be given to Hugo Heagren. He has been by
        far the best teacher I have had to date at King's. He has made
        the work understandable but also academically challenging
        through always providing detailed, specific and tailored
        feedback.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="display">
        {# From the GTA award nomination. Pretty sure this was Yaaseen. #}
        Hugo has been an amazing teacher. Always prioritising his
        students and going above and beyond during his seminars. He has
        provided me with tailored advice to improve my essay skills and
        philosophy knowledge and has someone who has never studied
        philosophy before, this is something I much appreciate.
