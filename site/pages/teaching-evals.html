    <p>
        Someone once told me that during my academic job search, I
        should make all my teaching eval data available online.
    </p>
    <p>
        This page displays the quantitative and qualitative
        evaluations on all my teaching to date (except those for
        which the module leader forgot to perform evaluation).
        Each module was evaluated with a questionnaire part-way
        through term, consisting mostly of statements scored for
        agreement from 1 (worst) to 5 (best), with a couple of
        qualitative comments at the end. For each module, there's
        a bar chart of the mean score on each quantitative
        measure, and then a subheading for each qualitative
        question with <em>all</em> of the comments quoted
        underneath. <i>n</i> is the number of students who filled
        out the survey.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before all that, here are two comments left anonymously by
        students outside of the official evaluation process. The second
        student nominated me for an award:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="display">
        {# From the email Jess sent me. Pretty sure this was Ollie. #}
        The most positive aspect was my experience in seminars. Some
        recognition needs to be given to Hugo Heagren. He has been by
        far the best teacher I have had to date at King's. He has made
        the work understandable but also academically challenging
        through always providing detailed, specific and tailored
        feedback.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="display">
        {# From the GTA award nomination. Pretty sure this was Yaaseen. #}
        Hugo has been an amazing teacher. Always prioritising his
        students and going above and beyond during his seminars. He has
        provided me with tailored advice to improve my essay skills and
        philosophy knowledge and has someone who has never studied
        philosophy before, this is something I much appreciate.
