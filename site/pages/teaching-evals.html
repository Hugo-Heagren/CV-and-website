        <p>
            Someone once told me that during my academic job search, I
            should make all my teaching eval data available online.
        </p>
        <p>
            This page displays the quantitative and qualitative
            evaluations on all my teaching to date. Each module was
            evaluated with a questionnaire part-way through term,
            consisting mostly of statements scored for agreement from
            1 (worst) to 5 (best), with a couple of qualitative
            comments at the end. For each module, there's a bar chart
            of the mean score on each quantitative measure, and then a
            subheading for each qualitative question with <em>all</em>
            of the comments quoted underneath (in their original form,
            without spell checking or other editorialising). <i>n</i>
            is the number of students who filled out the survey. There
            is also a bar chart of <a href="#averages">my average
            scores across all modules</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before all that, here are two comments left anonymously by
            students outside of the official evaluation process. The second
            student nominated me for an award:

            {# From the email Jess sent me. Pretty sure this was Ollie. #}
            The most positive aspect was my experience in seminars. Some
            recognition needs to be given to Hugo Heagren. He has been by
            far the best teacher I have had to date at King's. He has made
            the work understandable but also academically challenging
            through always providing detailed, specific and tailored
            feedback.

            {# From the GTA award nomination. Pretty sure this was Yaaseen. #}
            Hugo has been an amazing teacher. Always prioritising his
            students and going above and beyond during his seminars. He has
            provided me with tailored advice to improve my essay skills and
            philosophy knowledge and has someone who has never studied
            philosophy before, this is something I much appreciate.
