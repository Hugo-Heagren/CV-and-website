        <p class="bio">
            I am a PhD philosophy student at King's College London. I also
            spent a few wonderful months researching at UT Austin with Mark
            Sainsbury. I mostly work on foundational issues with intentional
            phenomena like language, perception and thought about objects.
            <br>
            My PhD project seeks to
            provide a unified theory of object-directed intentionality in
            these three domains, to vindicate the wide-spread intuition that
            they work in similar ways.
            <br>
            For a while I helped to run
            the <a href="https://www.lemm-london.co.uk/">Language,
            Epistemology, Metaphysics and Mind</a> group in London. I
            also work as an administrator/technical person for
            the <a href="https://www.philosophyandmedicine.org/">Sowerby
            Philosophy and Medicine Project</a> and
            the <a href="https://www.ai-humanity-london.com/">London
            AI and Humanity Partnership</a>, and previously for
            the <a href="https://philosophyarts.co.uk/">Centre for
            Philosophy and Art</a>.
            <br>
            I curate a
            <a href="https://bookwyrm.social/list/3425/s/non-philosophy-books-about-language">list of works of fiction</a> which approach questions about
            language, such as might be approached by philosophy, but not in
            the way that academic philosophy does.
            Outside academia, I sometimes write free open-source software,
            and I volunteer with
            the <a href="https://www.fsc.org.uk/">Forest School Camps</a>.
