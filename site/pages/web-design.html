            I build academic websites! If you want one, <a href="mailto:{{ 'hugo.heagren@kcl.ac.uk' | html_mung }}">get in touch</a>!
            <br>
            Lots of academics and postgrad student need a website,
            especially as they (you) set out on the job market. I have
            significant experience with building such sites, and I can help
            you with more or less of the process, however best fits. I also
            have lots of experience with the process and mechanics of buying
            and administering domain names, setting up email addresses and
            linking social media accounts to your site, embedding displays
            of your work, etc.
            <br>

   href="mailto:{{ 'hugo.heagren@kcl.ac.uk' | html_mung }}">{{ 'hugo.heagren@kcl.ac.uk' | html_mung }}</a>) or

            <span>There are basically two ways to build a website:</span>
            <h3>Platform (Squarespace/Wix/etc.)</h3>
            <p>
                First, I can build a site (or improve an existing site) in one
                of the popular website-building platforms like Wix or
                Squarespace. There are two major advantages to this setup: it's
                easier for you to maintain after I've built it (because it
                doesn't require any real programming skills) and these platforms
                include tools for buying and administering web addresses
                (otherwise you have to do this manually). I
                built <a href="https://philosophyarts.co.uk/">philosophyarts.co.uk</a>
                like this.
                <br>
                The downside of this way is that there is less flexibility in
                the design, and often things which seem like they should be easy
                can end up being surprisingly difficult (the changing pictures
                on the front page of the CPA site do work, but they're a bit of
                a hack and it's hard to maintain behind the scenes). In
                particular, these platforms are <em>not</em> aimed at academics,
                they're aimed at people starting small businesses, so there's no
                way to easily add automation for academic things like a list of
                publications. You also (often) have to pay for the platform
                itself, as well as paying for your domain name.
            </p>
            <h3>Scratch build (this site)</h3>
            <p>
                Second: I can build the whole site from scratch, doing the
                programming myself. This has complete flexibility, and I can do
                absolutely whatever you want. The downside is that maintaining
                it, adding extra features, and even simple updates require some
                programming skills. If you host through GitHub pages (as I would
                recommend) then you don't pay for the platform. This is useful
                if you want something unusual, and especially if you want any
                complicated automation. For example, on my own site I have a
                list of publication and talks, and I have the same lists on my
                CV, and these are both automatically generated from a central
                bibliography file so that the two are always in sync. If you
                host through GitHub pages (as I would recommend) then you don't
                pay for the platform.
            </p>
            <h1 id="process">Process</h1>
            <p>
                Here's how it works: first we do an initial consultation where
                we talk about what you want and look at examples of other sites,
                and work out the prices for things like web addresses and
                platforms. This usually takes about an hour, and I'll only
                charge you for it if you decide you want to take it further.
                (It's easiest to do this in person.)
                <br>
                After that, I go away and do everything I can on my own, and
                check in which you as we go. Generally the only thing we need
                significant coordination for is setting up payment for a web
                address.
            </p>
            <h1 id="prices">Prices and payment</h1>
            <p>
                I charge £35/hour to anyone with a regular income, and £25/hour
                to anyone without (for anyone outside the UK, we'd jointly agree
                some reasonable international rate before I did any work). I
                track my own time and just stack it as I go. A simple site would
                take something between 4 and 10 hours, including consultation
                and administration (buying domain names, etc.).
                <br>
                Usually I'll just invoice you once we're done, but if you want
                lots of complicated features or whatever, then I'd probably want
                part of the total in advance, part way (e.g. once I'd done 10
                hours of work).
                <br>
                You can pay however you like—paypal and direct bank
                transfer are probably simplest.
            </p>
            <h1 id="portfolio">Previous work</h1>
            Some examples of things I've done:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I built this, my own site, entirely from scratch. You can
                    see the source code in
                    <a href="https://github.com/Hugo-Heagren/CV-and-website">the
                    repo on GitHub.</a>
                    <input id="see-more" type="checkbox" class="abstract-toggle">
                    <label for="see-more" class="abstract-label">
                        Click to expand a
                        list of cool things this site does
                    </label>
                    <ul class="abstract">
                        <li>
                            It works really well on desktop and mobile platforms of
                            all sizes (in portrait and landscape).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It has all the right metadata built into it for Google
                            search to recognise it easily (Google me and I show up
                            immediately—lots of academic sites don't).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It automatically displays all the talks and publications
                            listed
                            in <a href="https://github.com/Hugo-Heagren/CV-and-website/blob/master/cv.bib">this
                            file on GitHub</a> (and automatically updates whenever I
                            add to the
                            file—my <a href="https://hugoheagren.com/Hugo-Heagren-CV.pdf">CV</a>
                            also does this and the CV and site stay in sync
                            automatically). This is useful as your CV gets bigger and
                            more complex, and keeping everything up to date by hand
                            gets more of a task.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It loads <em>really fast</em>, because it doesn't use
                            any JavaScript or external assets (not even for these clever
                            little collapsible sections!).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It
                            implements <a href="https://dr0.ch/email-munging/">advanced,

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It has a funny <a href="./404.html">custom 404 page</a>
                            (well I think it's funny—its pretty niche).

                </li>
                <li>
                    I built a <a href="https://philosophyarts.co.uk">site in
                    Squarespace for the Centre for Philosophy and
                    Arts</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I built <a href="https://www.ai-humanity-london.com/">a site
                    in Wix for the London AI and Humanity Partnership</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I also did quite a lot of work on
                    the <a href="https://www.aiglossary.co.uk/">Philosophical AI
                    glossary</a>.
