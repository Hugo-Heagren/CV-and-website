                    This is a list of practical tips for philosophy PhD students who
                    want to make a career out of academia. As I write this, I am a last
                    year PhD student and have very consciously treated my PhD as an
                    apprenticeship in being an academic. When I began, I conscientiously
                    went looking for advice on how to do well. I found and read lots of
                    articles called things like ‘ten top tips for PhD students’. They
                    had two things in common: they were all aimed either at science
                    students, or PhD students in general (often with a bias towards
                    science), and they were all incredibly vague.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was very frustrating. I had managed to get into a well
                    respected PhD program; I didn’t really need anyone to tell that me
                    it was good idea to use a calendar, meet with my supervisor, or not
                    work too hard (these all appear as real advice
                    on <a href="https://www.thesavvyscientist.com/tips-for-new-phd-students/">this
                    list</a>, which comes up if you Google ‘PhD advice’).
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I wanted was straightforward, <em>practical</em> advice,
                    ideally aimed at Philosophy students, covering things I might not
                    have thought of. So after three years of PhD study, here is an
                    attempt at some advice. It is a list of things you can <em>do</em>,
                    mostly pretty easily, which might help.

                    This list is not exhaustive or comprehensive, and is certainly not
                    a complete guide to doing a PhD or becoming an academic. Suggested

                            overnight accommodation. Some are very generous (and others
                            are not). This information is often quite difficult to pin
                            down, and generally the most reliable sources will be other,

                            lines, with different pots for conference attendance, research
                            visits (e.g. a studentship/professorship) and other research

                            Submit work to lots of conferences (and similar things). It’s
                            generally free to submit and often free or cheap to go, and as
                            a graduate student conferences are a great way to get feedback
                            on your work, build you CV and meet other people in your area.

                            Try to publish things. Ideally, you want to leave your PhD
                            with a couple of publications (though this <em>is</em> hard and
                            is <em>not</em> a requirement!)

                            Buy your own board pens. They are always going missing, and
                            having your own is helpful. I
                            think <a href="https://www.viking-direct.co.uk/en/p/6127956">these</a>
                            are the best ones, and they’re refillable.

                                Use a password manager. They’re free and easy to use. You will
                                need to sign up for <em>so many things</em> during your studies,
                                and managing all the logins gets old quickly. I
                                recommend <em>not</em> using the one which comes built into your
                                computer, because they often don’t have very good
                                backup/export functions, and passwords are one thing you
                                <em>definitely</em> want to be able to easily copy over onto
                                your next machine. Install one with good backup support, or
                                use a cloud-based one. I
                                use <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">passwordstore</a>.

                            <p>
                                Some people seem to believe that using a password manager
                                makes them vulnerable to attack, because someone could steal
                                their laptop and thus obtain all the passwords. This is not
                                true; all password managers use strong encryption which
                                would take a hacker millions of years to break. You are at
                                much greater risk if you use the same password for
                                everything, because many small companies won’t have very
                                good security, and so getting your account with them hacked
                                means an attacker has your password for everything else
                                (even the companies with better security).

                            designed to do. Don’t use google docs, word, doc(x) or plain

                            severe limitations which PDFs don’t. If you write in {{ LaTeX

                            <strong>Learn to touch type</strong>. It’s worth it, really,
                            trust me. There are a few different free courses online. I
                            used <a href="https://www.typingclub.com/">this one</a>. I did
                            it over a winter break, doing an hour lesson every morning for
                            a couple of weeks. It’s so worth it. I can now confidently
                            type a quote out of a book lying beside my laptop without
                            looking at the keys <em>or</em> the screen.

                            Ensure your computer has a proper PDF reader. PDF is a very
                            powerful format{{ footnoteref(4) }} and a lot of software won’t
                            let you see all that some PDFs have to offer. This is true of
                            the default readers of mac and windows. The industry standard
                            is <a href="https://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/otherversions">Adobe

                            look after yourself, but personally I

                            will spend a lot of time using Outlook-based software (whether
                            you like that idea or not!) so have a look at it. Some cool

                                    Learn the basics of {{ LaTeX }} (if you’re a logician or a
                                    philosopher of maths/science, learn more). Eventually, it will
                                    be useful, and you will be glad you learned it when you did
                                    rather than doing it on the hoof.

                                            When I learned, I found

                                                Personally, the most significant thing I’ve got out of {{
                                                LaTeX }} is its capacity to automate my referencing. Far and
                                                away the best tool for this
                                                is <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex">Biblatex</a>.
                                                I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend learning how to use
                                                Biblatex. There's
                                                some <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_biblatex">Overleaf

                                        </ul>

                                    <li>
                                        If you use {{ LaTeX }} a lot, or submit to lots of journals
                                        which do, then every time you do so, make and keep a template
                                        file, with all the right settings and macros, for the next time
                                        you need to submit to that journal. By the time you are old and
                                        grey like me, you’ll thank yourself. This is especially relevant
                                        for people who work in logic, phil. math. and phil. sci., where
                                        the journals often have quite strict {{ LaTeX }}-related
                                        policies.

                                            Recognise, right now, that your computer (laptop, desktop
                                            etc.) is temporary but the data on it is not. In other
                                            words: during your academic career there will come a point
                                            (probably in the next few years) where you need to use a new
                                            machine, but with the same data/files on it. If you stay in
                                            academia this will happen <em>many</em> times. Work out how
                                            you manage this transition <em>in advance</em>. there are
                                            basically two approaches:
                                        </p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>
                                                Don’t actually keep anything on the computer itself and
                                                use a cloud service (Google Drive, One Drive, Dropbox
                                                etc.) instead. Personally I don’t recommend this. Cloud
                                                services are expensive for large amounts of data, often
                                                don’t have much flexibility, and don’t allow you to work
                                                on planes (early career academics spend a surprising
                                                amount of time on planes!). They are also generally run by
                                                large companies who want to steal your data.

                                                Keep everything on the computer and learn to backup and
                                                restore your data. This will probably be (marginally) more
                                                complex but I think it’s worth it.

                                            clearly I prefer 2 to 1. but doing 1 is definitely better
                                            than doing neither!

                                            Write an email signature. It looks professional and your
                                            students may find it helpful. It should contain any relevant
                                            information, but don’t overdo it. As with many such things,
                                            the best way to judge this is to look at the signatures of
                                            those around you, and see which you find useful/professional
                                            and which you find annoying. Depending on your needs, you
                                            might include:

                                            Many universities offer travel insurance to all academic staff
                                            for things like conferences and you’ll become academic staff
                                            once you start teaching (i.e. during your phd). Find out if
                                            your institution offers travel insurance and if so how to sign
                                            up for it. Note though that it tends to be fairly basic, so if
                                            you have complex health needs or unusual risks, you might need
                                            something extra.

                                        I try not to force my working practices on others, but
                                        here’s one exception (relegated to a footnote): I recommend
                                        keeping all your notes in <em>one</em> place, and not worrying
                                        too much about categorising them. In an undergraduate
                                        degree, there is a lot of structure imposed on the different
                                        pieces of information you have to remember (one course on
                                        ethics, another on epistemology, etc., and different folders
                                        for each). Graduate-level and up philosophy almost never
                                        works like this: things you learn in one class will feed
                                        into other classes in similar and related areas, and
                                        especially as you start presenting and publishing, similar
                                        things will be true of your own work. Trying to artificially
                                        segment things from the get-go eventually leads to a
                                        situation where you want to write something down but don’t
                                        know where to put it and have to either force into an
                                        existing box (bad), create yet another box (worse—hard to
                                        find everything later) or <em>not</em> write it down at all
                                        (worst case scenario). Better to only have one box and use
                                        that for everything. A good search function hides a
                                        multitude of organisational sins.

                                        For the pedantic: yes, the PDF specification ISO 32000
                                        Section 12.6.4.15 <em>does</em> specify ways for PDFs to
                                        include transition animations between different pages. But a
                                        spec is only good as its (widespread) adoption and support
                                        for these transitions is not widely implemented, especially
                                        not in the sort of non-specialist PDF viewers often used for
                                        presenting at conferences.

                                        software as a service, so I’ve never really used Acrobat,
                                        but I recognise that most people don’t have the time or
                                        energy to care about such things.

                                        Some browsers (e.g.
                                        <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/assign-shortcuts-search-engines">Firefox</a>)
                                        will let you setup a keyword for a search form. I use ‘lib’ for the
                                        library, so I can type ‘lib foobar’ into my browser’s address bar
                                        and this has the same effect as going to the library search page and
                                        searching for ‘foobar’. I find this makes searching for things a bit
                                        faster. {%- endcall %}
