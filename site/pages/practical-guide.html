        This is a list of practical tips for philosophy PhD students who
        want to make a career out of academia. I’m a last year PhD
        student and have very consciously treated my PhD as an
        apprenticeship in being an academic. When I began, I conscientiously
        went looking for advice on how to do well. I found and read lots of
        articles called things like ’ten top tips for PhD
        students’. They had two things in common:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            they were all aimed either at science students, or PhD students
            in general (generally with a bias towards science)
        </li>
        <li>they were all incredibly vague</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This was very frustrating. I had managed to get into a well
        respected PhD program; I didn’t really need anyone to tell
        that me it was good idea to use a calendar, meet with my supervisor,
        or not work too hard (these all appear as real advice
        on <a href="https://www.thesavvyscientist.com/tips-for-new-phd-students/">this
        list</a>, which comes up if you Google ’PhD advice’).
    </p>
    <p>
        What I wanted was straightforward, <i>practical</i> advice, ideally
        aimed at Philosophy students. So after three years of PhD study,
        here is an attempt at some advice. It is a list of things you
        can <i>do</i>, mostly pretty easily, which might help.

                    one which can connect to (bib)LaTeX. Whenever people new to
                    graduate study ask me for advice, I tell them
                    this <i>first</i>. If you don’t know which to use,

                    Keep notes on pretty much everything. It’s easy to
                    write something down, especially on a computer. If
                    you’ve written it down, the worst that can happen is
                    that you never look at it again. But if you
                    <i>don’t</i> write it down the worst that can happen is
                    that you want to look at it again, and
                    can’t.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>

                <li>
                    Maintain a list of ideas for papers/books you want to write.
                    Never remove, only add.

                <li>
                    If you take on a job with billable hours (admin, building
                    academic websites, typesetting etc.) do <i>nothing</i> for
                    free. Charge for your time reading emails. You are definitely
                    the only person who cares about whether you are charging for
                    11 hours rather 10.5.

                    <li>
                        Find out as early as possible exactly what your department
                        will pay for vis a vis things like travel to conferences and
                        overnight accommodation. Some are very generous (and others
                        are not). This information is often quite difficult to pin
                        down, and generally the most reliable sources will be other,
                        more senior, grad students (there is usually a grad student
                        whatsapp group and/or mailing list which is good for this kind
                        of thing). Sometimes money is allotted along very fine-grained
                        lines, with different pots for conference attendance, research
                        visits (e.g. a studentship/professorship) and other research
                        expenses.

                    <li>
                        Submit work to lots of conferences (and similar things).
                        It’s generally free to submit and often free or cheap to
                        go, and as a graduate student conferences are a great way to
                        get feedback on your work, build you CV and meet other people
                        in your area.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Try to publish things. Ideally, you want to leave your PhD
                        with a couple of publications (though this <i>is</i> hard and
                        is <i>not</i> a requirement!)

                    <li>
                        Buy your own board pens. They are always going missing, and
                        having your own is helpful. I
                        think <a href="https://www.viking-direct.co.uk/en/p/6127956">these</a>
                        are the best ones, and they’re refillable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use a password manager. They’re free and easy to use.
                        You will need to sign up for <i>so many things</i> during your
                        studies, and managing all the logins gets old quickly. I
                        recommend <i>not</i> using the one which comes built into your
                        computer, because they often don’t have very good
                        backup/export functions, and passwords are one thing you
                        <i>definitely</i> want to be able to easily copy over onto
                        your next machine. Install one with good backup support, or
                        use a cloud-based one. I
                        use <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">passwordstore</a>.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>

                    <li>
                        Buy a second laptop charger and leave it at campus, so that
                        you don’t have to lug it to work and back every day. Do
                        the same for any other small things you can, just to make your
                        commute a bit easier (nice coffee cup, water bottle,
                        etc.).

                        You’ll often come across texts which are hosted on

                        (same journal, same PDF) are often also on Jstor for
                        free.

                        Whenever you distribute your papers/chapters/writing, use
                        PDF. Everyone can open and use them. This is literally what
                        PDF was designed to do. Don’t use google docs, word,
                        doc(x) or plain text. Not everyone can open these, and they
                        all have pretty severe limitations which PDFs don’t. If
                        you write in LaTeX, your should get PDFs out the other end by
                        default.

                        (really/practically) support fancy transitions between
                        slides,<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup> but if your talk gets
                        significantly worse without the transitions, it wasn’t a

                        Ensure your computer has a proper PDF reader. PDF is a very
                        powerful format<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> and a lot of software
                        won’t let you see all that some PDFs have to offer. This
                        is true of the default readers of mac and windows. The

                            be useful, and you will be glad you learned it when you did
                            rather than doing it on the hoof.

                                    The best learning resource for me (when I learned) was
                                    the
                                    <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX">wikibook</a>.

                                    Personally, the most significant thing I’ve got
                                    out of LaTeX is its capacity to automate my referencing.
                                    Far and away the best tool for this is bibLaTeX.
                                    I <b>strongly</b> recommend learning how to use
                                    BibLaTeX.

                            If you use LaTeX a lot, or submit to lots of journals which
                            do, then every time you do so, make and keep a template file
                            for the next time you need to submit to that journal. By the
                            time you are old and grey like me, you’ll thank
                            yourself. This is especially relevant for people who work in
                            logic, phil. math. and phil. sci., where the journals often
                            have quite strict LaTeX-related policies.

                                Recognise, right now, that your computer (laptop,
                                desktop etc.) is temporary but the data on it is not. In
                                other words: during your academic career there will come a
                                point (probably in the next few years) where you need to use
                                a new machine, but with the same data/files on it. If you
                                stay in academia this will happen <i>many</i> times. Work
                                out how you manage this transition <i>in advance</i>. there
                                are basically two approaches:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Don’t actually keep anything on the computer
                                    itself and use a cloud service (Google Drive, One Drive,
                                    Dropbox etc.) instead. Personally I don’t recommend
                                    this. Cloud services are expensive for large amounts of
                                    data, often don’t have much flexibility, and
                                    don’t allow you to work on planes (early career
                                    academics spend a surprising amount of time on planes!).
                                    They are also generally run by large companies who want to
                                    steal your data.

                                    Keep everything on the computer and learn to backup and
                                    restore your data. This will probably be (marginally) more
                                    complex but I think it’s worth it.
                                </li>

                                clearly I prefer 2 to 1. but doing 1 is definitely better
                                than doing neither!

                                Write an email signature. It looks professional and your
                                students may find it helpful. It should contain any relevant
                                information, but don’t overdo it. As with many such
                                things, the best way to judge this is to look at the
                                signatures of those around you, and see which you find
                                useful/professional and which you find annoying. Depending
                                on your needs, you might include:
                            </p>

                                    (e.g. prefixing your name with ’Dr’ or
                                    ’Professor’, if this sort of thing matters to
                                    you/your institution)

                            Many universities offer travel insurance to all academic
                            staff for things like conferences and you’ll become
                            academic staff once you start teaching (i.e. during your phd).
                            Find out if your institution offers travel insurance and if so
                            how to sign up for it. Note though that it tends to be fairly
                            basic, so if you have complex health needs or unusual risks,

                        could keep notes on practical things which helped you during
                        your time as a graduate student and then relay them to your

                                I try not to force
                                my working practices on others, but here’s one
                                exception (relegated to a footnote): I recommend keeping all
                                your notes in <i>one</i> place, and not worrying too much
                                about categorising them. In an undergraduate degree, there
                                is a lot of structure imposed on the different pieces of
                                information you have to remember (one course on ethics,
                                another on epistemology, etc., and different folders for
                                each). Graduate-level and up philosophy almost never works
                                like this: things you learn in one class will feed into
                                other classes in wsimilar and related areas, and especially
                                as you start presenting and publishing, similar things will
                                be true of your own work. Trying to artificially segment
                                things from the get-go eventually leads to a situation where
                                you want to write something down but don’t know where
                                to put it and have to either force into an existing box
                                (bad), create yet another box (worse—;hard to find
                                everything later) or <i>not</i> write it down at all (worst
                                case scenario). Better to only have one box and use that for
                                everything. A good search function hides a multitude of
                                organisational sins.

                                Some people seem to
                                believe that using a password manager makes them vulnerable
                                to attack, because someone could steal their laptop and thus
                                obtain all the passwords. This is not true; all password
                                managers use strong encryption which would take a hacker
                                millions of years to break. You are at much greater risk if
                                you use the same password for everything, because many small
                                companies won’t have very good security, and so
                                getting your account with them hacked means an attacker has
                                your password for everything else (even the companies with
                                better security).

                                yes, the PDF specification ISO 32000 Section
                                12.6.4.15 <i>does</i> specify ways for PDFs to include
                                transition animations between different pages. But a spec is
                                only good as its (widespread) adoption and support for these
                                transitions is not widely implemented, especially not in the
                                sort of non-specialist PDF viewers often used for presenting
                                at conferences.

                                Some browsers (e.g.
                                firefox) will let you setup a keyword for a search form. I
                                use ’lib’ for the library., so I can type
                                ’lib foobar’ into my browser’s address bar
                                and this has the same effect as going to the library search
                                page and searching for ’foobar’. I find this
