                    This is a list of practical tips for philosophy PhD students who
                    want to make a career out of academia. As I write this, I am a last
                    year PhD student and have very consciously treated my PhD as an
                    apprenticeship in being an academic. When I began, I conscientiously
                    went looking for advice on how to do well. I found and read lots of
                    articles called things like ‘ten top tips for PhD students’. They
                    had two things in common: they were all aimed either at science
                    students, or PhD students in general (often with a bias towards
                    science), and they were all incredibly vague.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was very frustrating. I had managed to get into a well
                    respected PhD program; I didn’t really need anyone to tell that me
                    it was good idea to use a calendar, meet with my supervisor, or not
                    work too hard (these all appear as real advice
                    on <a href="https://www.thesavvyscientist.com/tips-for-new-phd-students/">this
                    list</a>, which comes up if you Google ‘PhD advice’).
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I wanted was straightforward, <em>practical</em> advice,
                    ideally aimed at Philosophy students, covering things I might not
                    have thought of. So after three years of PhD study, here is an
                    attempt at some advice. It is a list of things you can <em>do</em>,
                    mostly pretty easily, which might help.

                <p>
                    This list is not exhaustive or comprehensive, and is certainly not
                    a complete guide to doing a PhD or becoming an academic. Suggested

                                    Use a password manager. They’re free and easy to use. You will
                                    need to sign up for <em>so many things</em> during your studies,
                                    and managing all the logins gets old quickly. I
                                    recommend <em>not</em> using the one which comes built into your
                                    computer, because they often don’t have very good
                                    backup/export functions, and passwords are one thing you
                                    <em>definitely</em> want to be able to easily copy over onto
                                    your next machine. Install one with good backup support, or
                                    use a cloud-based one. I
                                    use <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">passwordstore</a>.

                                    Some people seem to believe that using a password manager
                                    makes them vulnerable to attack, because someone could steal
                                    their laptop and thus obtain all the passwords. This is not
                                    true; all password managers use strong encryption which
                                    would take a hacker millions of years to break. You are at
                                    much greater risk if you use the same password for
                                    everything, because many small companies won’t have very
                                    good security, and so getting your account with them hacked
                                    means an attacker has your password for everything else
                                    (even the companies with better security).

                                Whenever you distribute your papers/chapters/writing, use PDF.
                                Everyone can open and use them. This is literally what PDF was
                                designed to do. Don’t use google docs, word, doc(x) or plain
                                text. Not everyone can open these, and they all have pretty
                                severe limitations which PDFs don’t. If you write in {{ LaTeX
                                }}, your should get PDFs out the other end by default.

                                                    (probably in the next few years) where you need to use a new
                                                    machine, but with the same data/files on it. If you stay in
                                                    academia this will happen <em>many</em> times. Work out how
                                                    you manage this transition <em>in advance</em>. There are
                                                    basically two approaches:

                                                        Don’t actually keep anything on the computer itself and
                                                        use a cloud service (Google Drive, One Drive, Dropbox
                                                        etc.) instead. Personally I don’t recommend this. Cloud
                                                        services are expensive for large amounts of data, often
                                                        don’t have much flexibility, and don’t allow you to work
                                                        on planes (early career academics spend a surprising
                                                        amount of time on planes!). They are also generally run by
                                                        large companies who want to steal your data.

                                                        Keep everything on the computer and learn to backup and
                                                        restore your data. This will probably be (marginally) more
                                                        complex but I think it’s worth it.

                                                    Clearly I prefer 2 to 1. But doing 1 is definitely better
                                                    than doing neither!

                                                    Write an email signature. It looks professional and your
                                                    students may find it helpful. It should contain any relevant
                                                    information, but don’t overdo it. As with many such things,
                                                    the best way to judge this is to look at the signatures of
                                                    those around you, and see which you find useful/professional
                                                    and which you find annoying. Depending on your needs, you
                                                    might include:
                                                </p>

                                                        (e.g. prefixing your name with ‘Dr’ or ‘Professor’, if
                                                        this sort of thing matters to you/your institution).

                                                    It is (or was once) widely conventional to begin your

                                                can see the structure of the page,
                                                search the table, go to different
                                                parts, and jump back forwards and backwards from your current position.
                                                You can get it for

                                            mine from scratch in plain HTML, but in this I am an exception.
                                            Using Wix, <a href="https://html5up.net/">html5up</a>, <a href="https://www.webnode.com/">webnode</a>
                                            or a similar builder is fine so long as you are confident in how
                                            to update the site in the future.

                                                    Many universities offer travel insurance to all academic staff
                                                    for things like conferences and you’ll become academic staff
                                                    once you start teaching (i.e. during your PhD). Find out if
                                                    your institution offers travel insurance and if so how to sign
                                                    up for it. Note though that it tends to be fairly basic, so if
                                                    you have complex health needs or unusual risks, you might need
                                                    something extra.

                                                I try not to force my working practices on others, but
                                                here’s one exception (relegated to a footnote): I recommend
                                                keeping all your notes in <em>one</em> place, and not worrying
                                                too much about categorising them. In an undergraduate
                                                degree, there is a lot of structure imposed on the different
                                                pieces of information you have to remember (one course on
                                                ethics, another on epistemology, etc., and different folders
                                                for each). Graduate-level and up philosophy almost never
                                                works like this: things you learn in one class will feed
                                                into other classes in similar and related areas, and
                                                especially as you start presenting and publishing, similar
                                                things will be true of your own work. Trying to artificially
                                                segment things from the get-go eventually leads to a
                                                situation where you want to write something down but don’t
                                                know where to put it and have to either force into an
                                                existing box (bad), create yet another box (worse—hard to
                                                find everything later) or <em>not</em> write it down at all
                                                (worst case scenario). Better to only have one box and use
                                                that for everything. A good search function hides a
                                                multitude of organisational sins.

                                                Section 12.6.4.15 <em>does</em> specify ways for PDFs to
                                                include transition animations between different pages. But a
                                                spec is only good as its (widespread) adoption and support
                                                for these transitions is not widely implemented, especially
                                                not in the sort of non-specialist PDF viewers often used for
                                                presenting at conferences.

                                                Some browsers (e.g.
                                                <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/assign-shortcuts-search-engines">Firefox</a>)
                                                will let you setup a keyword for a search form. I use ‘lib’ for the
                                                library, so I can type ‘lib foobar’ into my browser’s address bar
                                                and this has the same effect as going to the library search page and
                                                searching for ‘foobar’. I find this makes searching for things a bit
                                                faster. {%- endcall %}
