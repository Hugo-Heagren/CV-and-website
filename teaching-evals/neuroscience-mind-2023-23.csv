4,4,4,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,The readings have been very interesting - seminars are informative and increase my understanding of the difficult concepts - Hugo explains and summarises things clearly in a way that’s easy to understand ,,
5,4,4,5,4,4,3,3,3,0,,,I think Hugo goes through the discussion points as if we’ve completely understood the content but most of the time a few us don’t have a complete grasp on it- when we ask he explains them well but I think it would be helpful if he gave a brief overview of the reading and philosophical theories before we discussed. 
5,5,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,4,The seminar leader did a really great job and make me understand the topic a bit more than just by reading it myself.,,"Great job, I really like the flow of the content and reading the articles, kinda of opens my mind to what other people might think"
