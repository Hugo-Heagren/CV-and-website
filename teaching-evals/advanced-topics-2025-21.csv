5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"The content has been interesting however challenging yet, Hugo has a great way of explaining all the advanced stuff.","Essay options I'm not a great fan of, it seems the one I'm doing Bill has already fully answered making it hard to gage my own opinion on it",
5,4,4,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,I find it helpful to have questions sent by my seminar leader regarding the readings as they allow me to guide myself whilst reading. The questions also allow me to test my understanding of the reading. ,"Not something that's easy to resolve, but the timing of the first lecture makes it a bit difficult for people to get to, as well as the location being Strand. But in the lecture recording, the sound is usually a bit quiet.",

Hugo always answers questions making sure that we can fully clarify understanding.",No.,
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,The different views discussed on topics. It’s also nice that our seminar lead is enthusiastic about the topics we discuss. ,,
5,5,4,5,5,4,5,4,5,,The seminars are really useful for understanding the readings. ,I think that the readings are a bit too complex to understand for students not doing a philosophy based degree and who haven't experienced this level of philosophy before. ,
