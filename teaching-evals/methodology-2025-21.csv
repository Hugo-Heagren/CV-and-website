4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,,Tutor is very knowledgeable and able to explain the content of the course,,
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,,"Hugo has promoted stimulating Philosophical discussions within the Methodology seminars, enhancing my interest in the subject and pushing me to learn more and be more engaged with the topics ",,
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,,"Hugo always explains everything very well and goes through his thought process, which I find very useful. Hugo doesn’t view himself above the students which I appreciate very much and he’s makes things very clear. ",,Number 1 seminar leader in all of Kings college.
4,5,5,4,5,4,4,4,4,,"There is a clear structure to the seminars, but there is still flexibility to ask questions and discuss topics","A bit more explanations on the logic notations, if were required to know them for this module",
5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,Hugo helps link the information of methodology with other areas of philosophy which I found great as it helped my knowledge for not just this module but for the other modules I’m doing. It’s  also very clear that he’s an expert on the subject as he not only answers the questions very well and clearly but also stimulates discussion on quiz questions that are ambiguous.,He could give some more background information on the logic symbols and terminology that he uses in class as I have never done logic before (leading me to feel a bit lost when he does mention them).,
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,,Very interesting to think about and discuss - challenging but in a good way.,,
5,3,5,5,5,3,3,4,5,4,Your knowledge of the topic and the ability to answer questions about not always relating topics is impressive.,"My 'neurals' during the stimulation question are results of the topic and structure of the course. In comperison to discussion heavy subject it is more important to form a set of language. I prefer controvertial debates, but you do as much of them as possible.",
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,"Explains every question with clarity and receptive to questions that may stray outside the scope but is still relevant to what is required of the module content, ",,
4,5,5,4,5,5,3,5,4,,"Seminar leader is great and chill. Explanations of concepts go deepr than the lectures, gives other interesting/convenient options to tackle certain problems not mentioned in lecture slides which I like. Going over the exercises is a nice structure and usefull for exam preperations, tho kinda boring.",,
5,5,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,,,,
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"well structured, effective class, clear explanation",good enough for me ,
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,Seminar leading is very well prepared and answers questions effectively. Is good at balancing exam content with interesting non exam content. ,no,
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"Seminars have been informative, really helped me understand each weeks content more. Also Hugo is friendly and a very good communicator. ",,Thank you very much for teaching us!
4,4,5,4,5,5,4,4,5,4,Clearly explained process in terms of how we arrive at a specific question and clears up any confusion about that that process.,,Keep up the good work and have a good reading week !
4,4,4,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,Seminars have been informative and lectures engaging,,
5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,4,,,
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,The seminar leader maintained control over class discussion in a way that allowed for sufficient coverage of the set exercises each week and encouraged productive discussion about confusing or debated concepts and issues. He provided clarity on important subject matter covered in lectures using helpful examples and consistently encouraged students to question widely accepted philosophical views and voice their own opinions. ,,
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,,Hugo is clearly very knowledgeable on this subject and has always been able to incite interest by introducing philosophical ideas that haven’t been covered in lectures. He also has a knack for clarifying concepts that are harder to grasp. He’s been extremely helpful.,,
5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,Structured seminar that always feels purposeful. Seminar leader is a natural teacher.,Not really. Maybe pick on people to answer questions sometimes - we all chose to be there so I think you’re well within your rights to pick people rather than a few of us answering everything!,
5,5,4,4,5,5,4,4,3,,,,
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,Its very interesting yet is also clear about examinability,,
