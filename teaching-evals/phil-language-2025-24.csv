5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,I like how you have us bring our own questions because it encourages us to think about the topic more and we get to listen to other people's questions/opinions,Some of the material is very confusing so it's hard to get through everything in the seminar time ,
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"The discussions we are able to have with various contributions, helping to clarify topics and add unique insights. ","The module in general is very tricky (for me personally) so potentially a few of the more difficult to grasp topics could be explored in simpler terms initially and then expanded on, rather than delving into the intracacies; especially as the philosophical knowledge/experience is varied, and some people use rather complex phrasing. ","Hugo is extremely respectful and clear in explanations, it makes the seminars fun to attend "
5,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,The module explores a range of different philosophers' arguments which stimulates interesting conversations in seminars and urges me to assess the module material in a very holistic way.,"I think there could be use in providing more background information on certain aspects of the module, for example it requires a bit of background knowledge on logic which I have not studied prior. I think this would give me a better understanding of the module as a whole. ",
4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,Chance to clear up ideas,"The seminar sessions can be longer to allow for more clarifications of ideas (though I know it depends on the timetable), and if there can be alternative consultation slots (though I know this depends on the schedule of the instructor)",
4,4,3,5,5,3,5,5,4,4,"- very discussion based, so no repetition of previous information, and no extensive overlap with the lecture
- informal and open conversations, every question is welcome and answered thoroughly
- inclusive
- “everyone brings a question” builds an inquisitive relationship with the readings ","- would like to have heads up regarding what readings are atteignable for our level
- extremely fast paced for very dense materials that should maybe be studied for longer in more depth ",
4,4,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,,Seminars have helped to clarify muddy ideas / concepts that have been brushed over in lectures,Pressure to immediately engage in class-wide discussion, encouragement to speak with 1/2 partner(s) first might make discussion more lively / fruitful
5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,4,Hugo has been really helpful in explaining difficult topics and is responsive to questions. The learning environment is very comfortable and I come away from the seminars with a better understanding of the topics/reading. ,"Whilst the essay writing segment during week 4 was helpful, it taking up half of the seminar time on a week where the topic was relatively difficult was slightly frustrating. ",
4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,Hugo is very good at distilling complex ideas which makes the papers and ideas themselves less daunting and more interesting to read for myself,,
3,4,4,5,5,4,4,4,,4,Very clear demonstrative explanation of complicated topics. ,"sometimes the seminar leader does not have immediate answers to questions, although this is understandable it leads to questions being forgotten due to not being answered at the time. ",
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,Hugo is very interactive with the class and you are compelled to take interest in the discussion because it feels like a normal discussion everyone feels comfortable to take part and we have some very good discussions,no,
4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,,,
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"Struggling to understand the lecture/lecture notes, But then going into the seminar and clearing any doubts I have has helped me gain confidence","No, I think overall all very positive",
5,5,4,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,Hugo genuinely loves teaching us it seems so it really makes learning the content much more enjoyable ,"No, ",
4,4,4,4,5,3,5,4,4,,Very clear explanation on complex theory,,
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,"Course content - but also the seminars and seminar leader has particularly made this class enjoyable for me.

I found Hugo to be very balanced in his approach.",No - not necessarily.,Thank you Prof. Textor and Hugo for the first half of Semester 1 so far!
5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,,The class is interesting and makes for good discussions of the topics. It branches interest into further knowledge of the discipline. ,"The module topics should be a little more clear on the problem they are attempting to tackle. What questions are each of the weekly topics trying to answer and why that is important might help give a little direction as to why and in what way it matters that these topics be handled with. The seminars are interesting and immersive in the content, but could do with a little more practical application when relevant to the topic at hand. Although it is difficult as there are many degrees taking this class, but a little of connections to real world applications and connections would help visualize problems in the topics and help us understand the content in different ways.
