5,5,5,4,5,5,4,4,5,5,The seminar leader is able to effectively and clearly explain difficult concepts using simple and concise language.,The class is held too early in the day for my liking and sometimes the classroom is maybe too big for everyone to be able to see the board. ,The seminar leader is friendly and responsive to inquiry.

5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,4,4,The learning atmosphere feels really good and I feel that it helps straighten out things I was confused with in the lecture.,I wish we had more discussions with the people around us so we could connect with people in the seminar and find it easier to make friends in the course.,no

E.g., the lecture does not cover everything and it would be nice if this can be carried on in the seminar (ND: Negation and biconditional rules were barely gone over) ",Nil. Thanks sm Hugo.

There should be more resources provided, especially for natural deduction.

4,5,5,3,5,5,4,5,4,5,The module is a good way to rethink thinking (AKC!) and atleast reconsider the manner in which one communicates or engages in discourse. ,"Gentzen natural deduction is difficult, and we should do Fitch instead. There should be an extra week dedicated to Nat. Ded.","Hugo is a great teacher but is overly charitable to students who ask obvious, unneeded question. The class would be more effectively led if the advice given to some students was ""This has already been covered, refer to the lecture slides or come to office hours if you still have an issue"""
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,3,This module has been extremely interesting. I have learnt a lot from it. It's been intellectually stimulating. I have really enjoyed studying Logic. I am now considering studying Logic in the future as a result of this module. I wasn't expecting to enjoy Logic so much! These seminars have been well-taught.

5,4,4,5,3,4,,5,5,5,The content has been explained well to me. I like the weekly online exercises and think they have helped a lot and have provided good explanations for incorrect answers. I also appreciate the past papers and online materials which not many other modules have.,"This isn’t related to seminars but at times the lecture is really hard to comprehend when the content itself is not that difficult. I think some of the content, and especially the examples provided during the lecture, could be communicated in a more concise manner.",Often times people are talking and coughing in the lecture hall and it’s really hard to understand what’s being said but I think this isn’t an issue native to the module itself.
5,4,5,4,5,4,4,4,4,5,"Hugo is excellent, and clearly always tries his hardest, to make sure that students understand the material, and that they feel more informed after having their questions answered.

4,4,4,3,4,5,5,5,4,5,hugo is very good at explaining the concepts in an easy to grasp way and always has time to listen in office hours. he also continually highlights that it is a safe space to say if you don’t understand without being made to feel stupid. ,giving too much time to unrelated questions (ones that aren’t related at all to what we are doing) instead of directing them to office hours resulting in less time to go over logic. ,

5,5,5,5,5,5,3,4,5,4,I've found the seminars really useful in terms of consolidating the lecture material and clarifying any questions.,I think the natural deducation week should be two weeks just because it's a hard topic so I think two weeks would mean that it isn't rushed as much.,The seminars have generally been really useful and a good environment.
