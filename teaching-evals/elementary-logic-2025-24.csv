5,5,4,5,5,5,4,5,5,,Itâ€™s an engaging topic! ,The content in week 4 was rushed a bit ,"Genuinely most engaging seminar leader I have, very clear and a good natural teacher!"

5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"Friendly approachable staff
Interesting module
Plenty of practice to become great at logic","Lectures are confusing and sometimes hard to follow. However, seminars are easy to follow and informative.",
3,4,3,4,4,4,3,3,5,4,Questions are always answered regardless of how little.,"Sometimes I struggle because the seminar is so fast paced, and i feel sometimes we skip over the basics.",
4,4,3,4,5,5,5,5,3,,It's really fun,"I think a mindmap of what ""logic"" actually is would have been useful. And instructions on how to study for it",
4,4,5,4,4,3,3,3,3,,Hugo explains difficult concepts really clearly ,Perhaps to have a more comfortable environment (but this could be down to the fact that there are many students in the class),
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"Hugo is excellent: Friendly, engaging, explains patiently and simply, makes Logic a whole lot more approachable and tolerable (I initially thought Iâ€™d HATE it). My favorite seminar leader. Probably wouldnâ€™t attend half the seminars I do if he werenâ€™t here. ","Honestly, no? I think that Elementary Logic - or quite a few aspects of it, at least, especially for students who are new to it - is rather difficult (unintuitive, convoluted) but, like said above, Hugo is very engaging and terrific at simply explaining concepts that initially seem baffling. ",
4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,5,3,,"Natural deduction was a really challenging topic and I feel that it was not really clearly explained in the lecture, then the seminar helped explain a bit but it still wasnâ€™t clear and me and others just find that topic completely inaccessible, even referring back to the book/lecture/slides",
5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,3,,,,
5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,4,4,Getting feedback on my attempts at doing logic. It's been really helpful to use the seminar to clarify what I struggled to understand in the exercises.,"I think more time should be spent on proofs and the different rules. It didn't feel exactly clear what to do for them, and the readings set felt too advanced. However, the cheat sheets were somewhat helpful.","No. I do find it helpful when you contextualise the logic we are doing, though. Otherwise, it feels like we're just focusing on principles of logic rather than why or what we are doing it for."

4,5,4,4,5,5,4,4,5,,"Hugo goes over more examples than our lectures do, it clarifies the rules of logic for me and prepares me for the homework. We also go over specific cases which might not come up usually, which is helpful. ",The first two seminars I felt slightly out of the loop having never done Philosophy before. People in my seminar group would use terminology I wasnâ€™t familiar with and it would be helpful if Hugo hadâ€™ve clarified things for people like me who are new to this.,"I really enjoy the seminars overall, thank you!"
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,,Interesting content and clear explainations,Still a bit confused on one subject area - but that may be my own knowledge gap,
4,2,2,4,4,4,2,2,5,4,The seminar leader knows the content very well and can properly answer a variety of questions. ,Moves too fast and follows the only pace of the best performing students. Cold calling makes it difficult to listen and the class anxiety inducing. ,
4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,5,,,,
5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,"Clarification of the lecture material by participating in exercises in the seminar, which is really helpful. 

Having ""homework"" each week is really helpful in participating and making sure to do the exercises in book of problems ",Nope! Thank you for your help so far!,Thank you for your help so far!
