This folder contains teaching evaluation data (and nothing beyond that
data). The data is stored in CSV files. Each file represents one
session of one teaching for one course, so a course taught in the
spring term of 2024, and then again in the spring term of 2025 has two
files, one for each teaching session. 

The name of each file is `<COURSE-NAME>-<YEAR>-<SEASON>.csv` where
SEASON is the season number in [ISO
8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html): 21 for
spring, 22 for summer, 23 for autumn/fall, and 24 for winter.

Each file has columns:
1. The seminar leader was well prepared
2. The seminar leader gave interesting and informative classes
3. The seminar leader explained the subject clearly
4. The seminar leader was effective in leading the class or seminar
5. The seminar leader is receptive to students' questions
6. The seminar leader stimulates interest in the subject
7. The seminar leader stimulates discussion on the subject
8. The seminar leader stimulates me to think and learn
9. The seminar leader has a good rapport with the class
10. The seminar leader is available to answer questions during office
    hours
11. What have been the positive features of this module up to this
    point?
12. Were there any negative features of this module up to this point?
