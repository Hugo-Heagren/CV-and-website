    <h1>Process and prices</h1>

    <p>
      Here's how it works: first we do an initial consultation where
      we talk about what you want and look at examples of other sites,
      and work out the prices for things like web addresses and
      platforms. This usually takes about an hour, and I'll only
      charge you for it if you decide you want to take it further.
      (It's easiest to do this in person.)

    <br>

      After that, I go away and do everything I can on my own, and
      check in which you as we go. Generally the only thing we need
      significant coordination for is setting up payment for a web
      address.

    <br>

      I charge £35/hour—I track my own time and just stack it as I go. A
      simple site would take something between 4 and 10 hours, including
      consultation and administration (buying domain names, etc.).

    <br>

      Usually I'll just invoice you once we're done, but if you want
      lots of complicated features or whatever, then I'd probably want
      part of the total in advance, part way (e.g. once I'd done 10
      hours of work).

    <h1>Previous work</h1>
    Some examples of things I've done:

    <ul>
      <li>I built this, my own site entirely from scratch. You can see
	the source code in
	<a href="https://github.com/Hugo-Heagren/CV-and-website">the
	  repo on GitHub</a></li>
      <li>I built a <a href="https://philosophyarts.co.uk">site in
	  Squarespace for the Centre for Philosophy and
	  Arts</a>./</li>
      <li>I built <a href="https://www.ai-humanity-london.com/">a site
      in Wix for the London AI and Humanity Partnership</a>.</li>

      <li> I also did quite a lot of work on
	the <a href="https://www.aiglossary.co.uk/">Philosophical AI
	glossary</a></li>
    </ul>
