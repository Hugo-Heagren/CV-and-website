      I build academic websites! If you want one, <a href="mailto:{{
      'hugo.heagren@kcl.ac.uk' | html_mung }}">get in touch</a>!

      <br>

      Lots of academics and postgrad student need a website,
      especially as they (you) set out on the job market. I have
      significant experience with building such sites, and I can help
      you with more or less of the process, however best fits. I also
      have lots of experience with the process and mechanics of buying
      and administering domain names, setting up email addresses and
      linking social media accounts to your site, embedding displays
      of your work, etc.

      <br>

      If you want to know more, email me (<a class="email"
               href="mailto:{{ 'hugo.heagren@kcl.ac.uk' | html_mung
               }}">{{ 'hugo.heagren@kcl.ac.uk' | html_mung }}</a>) or
               fill out
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdjIFwvcJmHYzrEr_CBdRBeBLkH5ZJVHllFbqoQUaIFaQgRCQ/viewform?usp=dialog">this
               form</a>.

    <span>There are basically two ways to build a website:</span>

    <h3>Platform (Squarespace/Wix/etc.)</h3>

    <p>
      First, I can build a site (or improve an existing site) in one
      of the popular website-building platforms like Wix or
      Squarespace. There are two major advantages to this setup: it's
      easier for you to maintain after I've built it (because it
      doesn't require any real programming skills) and these platforms
      include tools for buying and administering web addresses
      (otherwise you have to do this manually). I
      built <a href="https://philosophyarts.co.uk/">philosophyarts.co.uk</a>
      like this.

      <br>

      The downside of this way is that there is less flexibility in
      the design, and often things which seem like they should be easy
      can end up being surprisingly difficult (the changing pictures
      on the front page of the CPA site do work, but they're a bit of
      a hack and it's hard to maintain behind the scenes). In
      particular, these platforms are <em>not</em> aimed at academics,
      they're aimed at people starting small businesses, so there's no
      way to easily add automation for academic things like a list of
      publications. You also (often) have to pay for the platform
      itself, as well as paying for your domain name.
    </p>

    <h3>Scratch build (this site)</h3>

    <p>
      Second: I can build the whole site from scratch, doing the
      programming myself. This has complete flexibility, and I can do
      absolutely whatever you want. The downside is that maintaining
      it, adding extra features, and even simple updates require some
      programming skills. If you host through GitHub pages (as I would
      recommend) then you don't pay for the platform. This is useful
      if you want something unusual, and especially if you want any
      complicated automation. For example, on my own site I have a
      list of publication and talks, and I have the same lists on my
      CV, and these are both automatically generated from a central
      bibliography file so that the two are always in sync. If you
      host through GitHub pages (as I would recommend) then you don't
      pay for the platform.
    </p>

    <h1 id="process">Process</h1>

    <p>
      Here's how it works: first we do an initial consultation where
      we talk about what you want and look at examples of other sites,
      and work out the prices for things like web addresses and
      platforms. This usually takes about an hour, and I'll only
      charge you for it if you decide you want to take it further.
      (It's easiest to do this in person.)

    <br>

      After that, I go away and do everything I can on my own, and
      check in which you as we go. Generally the only thing we need
      significant coordination for is setting up payment for a web
      address.

    </p>

    <h1 id="prices">Prices and payment</h1>

    <p>
      I charge £35/hour to anyone with a regular income, and £25/hour
      to anyone without (for anyone outside the UK, we'd jointly agree
      some reasonable international rate before I did any work). I
      track my own time and just stack it as I go. A simple site would
      take something between 4 and 10 hours, including consultation
      and administration (buying domain names, etc.).

    <br>

      Usually I'll just invoice you once we're done, but if you want
      lots of complicated features or whatever, then I'd probably want
      part of the total in advance, part way (e.g. once I'd done 10
      hours of work).
    
    <br>

      You can pay however you like—paypal and direct bank
      transfer are probably simplest.

    Some examples of things I've done:

    <ul>
      <li>I built this, my own site, entirely from scratch. You can
	see the source code in
	<a href="https://github.com/Hugo-Heagren/CV-and-website">the
	  repo on GitHub.</a>
	<input id="see-more" type="checkbox" class="abstract-toggle">
	<label for="see-more" class="abstract-label">Click to expand a
	list of cool things this site does</label>
	<ul class="abstract">
	  <li>It works really well on desktop and mobile platforms of
	  all sizes (in portrait and landscape).</li>
	  <li>It has all the right metadata built into it for Google
	  search to recognise it easily (Google me and I show up
	  immediately—lots of academic sites don't). </li>
	  <li>It automatically displays all the talks and publications
	    listed
	    in <a href="https://github.com/Hugo-Heagren/CV-and-website/blob/master/cv.bib">this
	    file on GitHub</a> (and automatically updates whenever I
	    add to the
	    file—my <a href="https://hugoheagren.com/Hugo-Heagren-CV.pdf">CV</a>
	    also does this and the CV and site stay in sync
	    automatically). This is useful as your CV gets bigger and
	    more complex, and keeping everything up to date by hand
	    gets more of a task.</li>
	  <li>It loads <em>really fast</em>, because it doesn't use
	  any JavaScript or external assets (not even for these clever
	    little collapsible sections!).</li>
	  <li> It
	      implements <a href="https://dr0.ch/email-munging/">advanced,
	      standards-compliant email address munging</a>.</li>
	  <li>It has a funny <a href="./404.html">custom 404 page</a>
	  (well I think it's funny—its pretty niche).</li>
	  <li>All this could be yours!</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>I built a <a href="https://philosophyarts.co.uk">site in
	  Squarespace for the Centre for Philosophy and
	  Arts</a>.</li>
      <li>I built <a href="https://www.ai-humanity-london.com/">a site
      in Wix for the London AI and Humanity Partnership</a>.</li>

      <li> I also did quite a lot of work on
	the <a href="https://www.aiglossary.co.uk/">Philosophical AI
	glossary</a>.</li>
    </ul>
