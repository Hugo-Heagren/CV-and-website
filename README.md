# My Academic CV and website

The CV is in LaTeX, with BibLaTeX for automatically laying out my
talks. One day I'll have enough publications for it to be worth
writing the code for them too.

It's built with LuaLaTeX and deployed with a GitHub action to
[cv.hugoheagren.com/Hugo-Heagren-CV.pdf](https://cv.hugoheagren.com/Hugo-Heagren-CV.pdf).

The website tries to strike a reasonable balance between being simple
enough to stay out of my way and clever enough that I shouldn't have
to update it manually very often.

It's built with [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)
and deployed automatically by GitHub pages to
[hugoheagren.com](https://hugoheagren.com).
