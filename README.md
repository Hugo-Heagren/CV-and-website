# My Academic CV

Simple academic CV in LaTeX, with BibLaTeX for automatically laying
out my talks. One day I'll have enough publications for it to be worth
writing the code for them too.

It's automatically built and deployed with a GitHub action to
[cv.hugoheagren.com/Hugo-Heagren-CV.pdf](https://cv.hugoheagren.com/Hugo-Heagren-CV.pdf).
