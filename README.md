# My Academic CV and website

The CV is in LaTeX, with BibLaTeX for automatically laying out all the
lists. It's built with LuaLaTeX and deployed with a GitHub action to
[hugoheagren.com/Hugo-Heagren-CV.pdf](https://hugoheagren.com/Hugo-Heagren-CV.pdf).

The website tries to strike a reasonable balance between being simple
enough to stay out of my way and clever enough that I shouldn't have
to update it manually very often.

It's built with [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)
and deployed automatically by GitHub pages to
[hugoheagren.com](https://hugoheagren.com).
