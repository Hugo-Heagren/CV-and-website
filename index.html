    <p class="bio">
      I am a PhD philosophy student at King's College London. I mostly
      work on foundational issues with intentional phenomena like
      language, perception and thought about objects.

      <br>
      
      My PhD project seeks to
      provide a unified theory of object-directed intentionality in
      these three domains, to vindicate the wide-spread intuition that
      they work in similar ways.

      <br>

      For a while I helped to run
      the <a href="https://www.lemm-london.co.uk/">Language,
      Epistemology, Metaphysics and Mind</a> group in London. I also
      work as an administrator/technical person for
      the <a href="https://philosophyarts.co.uk/">Centre for
      Philosophy and Art</a>,
      the <a href="https://www.philosophyandmedicine.org/">Sowerby
      Philosophy and Medicine Project</a> and
      the <a href="https://www.ai-humanity-london.com/">London AI and
      Humanity Partnership</a>.

      <br>

      Outside academia, I sometimes write free open-source software,
      and I volunteer with
      the <a href="https://www.fsc.org.uk/">Forest School Camps</a>.
