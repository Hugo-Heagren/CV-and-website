    <p class="bio"> 
      I am a PhD student at King's College London. I mostly work on
      foundational issues with intentional phenomena like language,
      perception and thought about objects.

      <br>
      
      My PhD project seeks to
      provide a unified theory of object-directed intentionality in
      these three domains, to vindicate the wide-spread intuition that
      they work in similar ways.

      <br>

      Outside academia, I sometimes write free open-source software,
      and I volunteer with
      the <a href="https://www.fsc.org.uk/">Forest School Camps</a>.
