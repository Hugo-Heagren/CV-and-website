  <p class="bio">
    I am a PhD philosophy student at King's College London. I also
    spent a few wonderful months researching at UT Austin with Mark
    Sainsbury. I mostly work on foundational issues with intentional
    phenomena like language, perception and thought about objects.

    <br>
    
    My PhD project seeks to
    provide a unified theory of object-directed intentionality in
    these three domains, to vindicate the wide-spread intuition that
    they work in similar ways.

    <br>

    For a while I helped to run
    the <a href="https://www.lemm-london.co.uk/">Language,
      Epistemology, Metaphysics and Mind</a> group in London. I also
    work as an administrator/technical person for
    the <a href="https://philosophyarts.co.uk/">Centre for
      Philosophy and Art</a>,
    the <a href="https://www.philosophyandmedicine.org/">Sowerby
      Philosophy and Medicine Project</a> and
    the <a href="https://www.ai-humanity-london.com/">London AI and
      Humanity Partnership</a>.

    <br>

    I curate a
    <a href="https://bookwyrm.social/list/3425/s/non-philosophy-books-about-language">
      list of works of fiction</a> which approach questions about
    language, such as might be approached by philosophy, but with
    not in the way that academic philosophy does.

    Outside academia, I sometimes write free open-source software,
    and I volunteer with
    the <a href="https://www.fsc.org.uk/">Forest School Camps</a>.
