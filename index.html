                I am a PhD philosophy student at King's College London. I also
                spent a few wonderful months researching at UT Austin with Mark
                Sainsbury. I mostly work on foundational issues with intentional
                phenomena like language, perception and thought about objects.
                <br>
                My PhD project seeks to
                provide a unified theory of object-directed intentionality in
                these three domains, to vindicate the wide-spread intuition that
                they work in similar ways.
                <br>
                For a while I helped to run
                the <a href="https://www.lemm-london.co.uk/">Language,
                Epistemology, Metaphysics and Mind</a> group in London. I also
                work as an administrator/technical person for
                the <a href="https://philosophyarts.co.uk/">Centre for
                Philosophy and Art</a>,
                the <a href="https://www.philosophyandmedicine.org/">Sowerby
                Philosophy and Medicine Project</a> and
                the <a href="https://www.ai-humanity-london.com/">London AI and
                Humanity Partnership</a>.
                <br>
                I curate a
                <a href="https://bookwyrm.social/list/3425/s/non-philosophy-books-about-language">list of works of fiction</a> which approach questions about
                language, such as might be approached by philosophy, but not in
                the way that academic philosophy does.
                Outside academia, I sometimes write free open-source software,
                and I volunteer with
                the <a href="https://www.fsc.org.uk/">Forest School Camps</a>.
