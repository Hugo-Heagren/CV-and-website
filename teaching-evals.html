            This page displays the quantitative and qualitative evaluations
            on all my teaching to date (except those for which the module
            leader forgot to perform evaluation). Each module was evaluated
            with a questionnaire part-way through term, consisting mostly of
            questions scored from 1 (worst) to 5 (best), with a couple of
            qualitative comments at the end. For each module, there's a bar
            chart of the mean score on each quantitative question, and then
            a subheading for each qualitative question with <em>all</em> of
            the comments quoted underneath. <i>n</i> is the number of
            students who filled out the survey.

            Before all that, here are two comments left anonymously by
            students outside of the official evaluation process. The second
            student nominated me for an award:

            {# From the email Jess sent me. Pretty sure this was Ollie. #}
            The most positive aspect was my experience in seminars. Some
            recognition needs to be given to Hugo Heagren. He has been by
            far the best teacher I have had to date at King's. He has made
            the work understandable but also academically challenging
            through always providing detailed, specific and tailored
            feedback.

            Hugo has been an amazing teacher. Always prioritising his
            students and going above and beyond during his seminars. He has
            provided me with tailored advice to improve my essay skills and
            philosophy knowledge and has someone who has never studied
            philosophy before, this is something I much appreciate.
