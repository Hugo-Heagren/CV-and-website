      <!-- This is an advanced, standards compliant, method for
	   munging email addresses. I'm not sure how important munging is
	   these days, but it's good to be sure. Other academics do it
	   sometimes on their sites (generally the more technically
	   inclined ones) and doing it like this in an interesting little
	   flex, for the few (any?) who see it.

	   (if you are reading this comment in a modern web browser,
	   the munging won't be visible. Try viewing the source on
	   GitHub instead)

	   If you have made it to the bottom of this comment then, like
	   me, you should probably get out more. -->
