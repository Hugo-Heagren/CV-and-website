	abstract = {Vague names, like “Everest” and “Belle Epoque”
                  seem to refer to objects without clear boundaries.
                  Supervaluationism claims that this vagueness is a
                  feature of language, not of the objects referred to;
                  vagueness in names is just ambiguity between many
                  possible referents. This general idea admits of two
                  more specific versions. Both give similar treatments
                  of standard uses of vague names, but have very
                  different results for other cases, such as reference
                  achieved by descriptions including mentioned names.
                  Considering two examples, I show neither variant of
                  supervaluationism can account for the truth of all
                  types of sentences about those names themselves. If
                  I am right that these types exhaust
                  supervaluationism, the theory is shown to be false.
                  This problem closely resembles others in the
                  super-valuationist literature about disquotation
                  failure for truth. Treatments of vague truth and
                  vague reference come apart though, and I show that
                  the two problems are different enough that none of
                  the popular solutions will succeed for reference. I
                  consider—and reject—several specific objections, and
                  two more general ways to recover supervaluationism
                  following my arguments. I conclude that
                  supervaluationism is at best a useful formalism for
                  some kinds of vagueness reference, but fails as a
                  general account.}

	abstract = {Some thoughts have ‘objects’—things those thoughts
                  are about. Answers to questions about the relation
                  between thoughts and their objects often appeal to a
                  distinction between singular and general thoughts.
                  Singular thoughts are supposed to have somehow more
                  particular or specific objects, general thoughts
                  less so. I argue that no such distinction exists,
                  and that though one could be constructed this would
                  not be philosophically useful. §1 surveys views on
                  the nature of the singular/general distinction. §2
                  lists three problems with this distinction.
                  Consideration of these problems leads to a
                  finer-grained distinction between singular and
                  general concepts in §3, and I motivate this with
                  examples and methods of argument from literature in
                  §4. In the last section I consider a possible
                  objection. I argue that though there is a sense in
                  which it is technically correct, it does not achieve
                  anything philosophically useful.}
